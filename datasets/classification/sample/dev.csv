"'you indeed sound tired bipolar. bipolar is when you take things to such extremes. it is a terrible illness. i suffered it myself at one point, and have taken lithium and a variety of other medications to deal with it. its not so bad. it helps. but ultimately the problem is a psychological one. youre going to have to feel your way around your body and understand your own psychological profile, your triggers and so forth.what is also tired important to note that bipolarity is a two way street. you might have these extreme moments of aversion (the knife carving incident), but what people dont realize is that you also have your moment of desires, or what i mean by that is, you go way too far into the things you love.if you were just a bit more indifferent about things youd stabilize a great deal, i think, having had the illness. obviously stop taking drugs and stuff like that if youre taking them, but also stop staying up so late, or doing whatever it is you do to an extreme. live a balanced life. bonus points if you find that life boring. acclimate to that and make it your new norm, a stable life is a happy life. live a stable life where you are relatively indifferent to most things, you will enjoy your accumulated efforts over the years and you will be pleased. do not <allcaps> go into extremes of pain and pleasure, which is essentially what you are doing. leave well enough alone.",supportive
"'my mother had the same attitude. <repeat> she used to be abusive and violent too. thing is, these people can be quite cowardly in the face of it. if you do what you need to do without consulting them they hate it, but the more you ignore their demands in light of what you need to be well, they will back down. they have no choices, but you can have them.",supportive

"'you just pointed out **two <allcaps>** options and then said that **every** path is hopeless. what about these:what age are you? if you are above the age of majority i can see no reason why you seeking out medical help yourself would be of detriment, even in that environment. youve already placed a target smack bang on your fathers head here. i guess the question that you should ask yourself is, are you considering suicide (at least on some level) as a way to get at your father and <allcaps> escape your misery. all i am suggesting is you should consider the roots of this first. you could be in a state now, but if you go get your own help at the very least that sense of agency could help you out. even if you do resolve for suicide later on.think for a second, you are trapped and are considering the most exemplary option of agency (self-termination) as the option. so, it would be rather inconsequential, but effective, to do what you need to do and go sort out your own shit. in spite of your father.",supportive

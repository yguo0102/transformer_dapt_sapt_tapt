"it can be hard to appreciate the notion that you could meet someone else who will make you happy when you are so deeply in love with your boyfriend. your desires are set on him and not much else will make you happy at the moment. but over time the mind has a way of dealing with loss, this is a proven fact in psychology. over time, one day you will arrive at a level where you again feel at peace and can start feeling comfortable at looking into new relationships.it is certainly uncomfortable dealing with your current situation but do understand that with some time and patience the pain will go away and you will get through the difficulties that many us <allcaps> students are encountering with debt, unemployment and undervalued degrees.these are problems that many of us are facing right now, you are not alone. it is crushing to face all these difficulties at the same time, but getting through them is what is going to make us stronger, smarter and more emotionally aware than any generation that came before us.

have you recently sought to gain happiness by providing joy to another? i myself tired much enjoy gaining scientific knowledge, but i find making others happy and the pursuit of flow, the state of ones skill level meeting ones challenge, the things that make me the most happy. i also gain great pleasure from stories, relating to the trials of a character and his achievements, hopes and failures.i can try to prescribe these activitys for you, but if the pursuit of knowledge is truly what can stimulate action from you, if it gives you a reason to act and to have goals and to watch yourself achieve them then perhaps you could try to live your life furthering humanitys understanding of the universe. you also have a penchant for philosophy (which is ultimately the school of thought that your ideas lie in, merely borrowing from physics to explain them). maybe you could try to find your solution within philosophical texts.my point is that you have a capable brain, and i judge you as being far from unimportant, both to our species and to myself. the universe cannot disagree, as unfortunately for it it has no means (to our species knowledge) of observing our existence.i want you to know that i responded to your post because it stimulated my mind, and not because i had the need to stop you from dying. your existence has meaning with me for a quality you are lucky to possess, not just because you are another faceless member of humanity and i have some broad sweeping principle idea that no humans should commit suicide. your existence holds meaning with me, and with others, and so i bid you temporarily excuse its lack of meaning with you and the universe.if you commit suicide now, it will be too late. i already have felt your existence affect my life, and because of that your own existence will have a hand in shaping my future existence, which will shape the existence of many others, inanimate or not. you cannot stop yourself from having existed, only from continuing to exist. you lost the chance to not affect the rest of universe during conception, and now you have no choice but to continue affecting it, one way or another. that said, i challenge you to the pointless task of living a full life and going out in a blaze of beautiful glory, having positively touched the lives of many others (just as you have already touched my own) and having achieved a goal that holds a grand measure of importance to *you*. you say that you cannot commit suicide until you are sure that it is the answer, and i say that just because you or i cannot know the point of our existence does not mean that there is not one. i say that until you experience the the wonder of pure joy resulting from having filled another with joy, that until you have achieved something that is important to the unique individual human being that is you, that until you have lived a tired fulfilled existence that you cannot accurately judge whether there is a point to it or not, at all.i leave the rest up to you, i have given you my surest reasoning as to the point of continued existence and you have the choice of believing it, or denying it and nitpicking at my interpretation in order to fulfill the world view you have previously indicated you have or fear may be true of the universe. <repeat> or you can simply take a small part or two of what i have said and use it to shape a new view. i invite you to live gloriously, pointlessly, and awesomely and this invitation will not expire.",supportive
"the thing is, black holes dont swallow space around them like a vacuum, they have a limited size gravitational field and masses outside of that field are unaffected. what i mean is, a black hole will not simply pull all objects towards it, only the ones within the reach of its gravitational force. furthermore, wikipedia states ""in <number> stephen hawking showed that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation.[<number>] he got this result by applying quantum field theory in a static black hole background. the result of his calculations is that a black hole should emit particles in a perfect black body spectrum. this effect has become known as hawking radiation. since hawkings result, many others have verified the effect through various methods.[<number>] if his theory of black hole radiation is correct, then black holes are expected to emit a thermal spectrum of radiation, and thereby lose mass, because according to the theory of relativity mass is just highly condensed energy (e = mc<number>).[<number>] black holes will shrink and evaporate over time. the temperature of this spectrum (hawking temperature) is proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which for a schwarzschild black hole is inversely proportional to the mass. large black holes, therefore, emit less radiation than small black holes.""so, black holes dont last forever, they actually lose mass over time! furthermore, given the length of time we have until our sun becomes a red giant and the earth becomes uninhabitable, humans have a large fighting chance of being able to populate habitable planets surrounding other stars. if life is designed to perpetuate life, through means of natural selection as well as through survival during celestial travel via [panspermia](<url>), as well as through the eventual evolution of cognitive function, which grows into scientific reasoning and technological advances eventually leading into a species gaining the ability to inhabit other worlds, then the destruction of our solar system will not mark the end of life. it may mark the end of humans, theres no way to tell. <repeat> but i can tell you confidently that we wont take it lying down. when species compete with each other to adapt and be the fittest for survival, the real winner is always biodiversity for earths biosphere as a whole. a variety of species in many areas living many different ways increases the likelihood of life continuing, in any form, by reducing the risk of any single catastrophic event occurring.i guess my point is that life will strive to continue, and singularities dont last forever. if you follow the big bounce theory then all mass and energy would continue to exist following the next big bang, should the universe return to a singularity once more. there is a point to our lives as humans, and we will continue to struggle to claim our place in the universe. please dont give up hope. im sorry my answer is more science-y and less therapeutic. if you feel you need some engaging discussion with someone who is willing to put forth the effort into actively seeking to understand your ideas, im more than willing to talk via pm <allcaps> or right here in the comments.

"'new stars are made all the time, whilst old ones burn out. sentient life with the ability to travel to and inhabit other planets (especially with the ability to terraform them precolonization) can manage to survive the appearance of a black hole occurring within its home solar system, and in theory survive like this providing it the ability to survive most celestial disasters. a universal cataclysm may be enough to take out a species or group of species living in such a manner, but we dont know enough about the end of the universe, or the possibilities of life experiencing extra-dimensional travel in order to truly say with any confidence what could happen. i find myself perplexed with my ideas surrounding life, for if it is designed (i use this word in the least literal sense possible) to survive cataclysms and disasters and black holes and the impact of other celestial bodies and continue to multiply and diversify and survive, i wonder at its purpose. surely there is a reason. <repeat> i find myself drawn into some ideas i picked up when reading a short bit of raymond kurzweils the singularity is near. i strongly suggest reading that book for a taste of his tired interesting and stimulating ideas on evolution, both in the biological world and the inorganic world. i should go back to it myself. alas, i will have to continue this discussion tomorrow, like yourself ive had a few drinks tonight, and more than my fair share of hoots this afternoon. dont lose hope friend, and i hope you can find a measure of solace in the knowledge that having a human being like yourself in the gene pool, who can actively ponder the philisophical dilemma of humanities ultimate universal fate is evolutionarily genius, and nothing but a boon for our species. you truly belong in humanity, and we are better for your presence.",supportive

it can be hard to break that.  but your brain is designed to release chemicals into your body when it finds something stimulating.  laziness keeps you from getting those chemicals.  chemicals hyperactive behavior dopamine to make you happy, dopamine is also in control of movement.which is why people who work out can get really happy doing so.  takes a while, but it can fight mental

that stimulation released chemicals in your brain.  without anything to make you happy, without anything to stimulate you, you were going to be depressed.but it takes your sheer will to not have these

fortunate for you, youre given the opportunity to understand this.my advice to you would be this.  get yourself a gym membership.  you may feel embarrassed, but that goes away its just a response.  dont watch tv <allcaps> or get video games, go out and do things.  do things with real people.  it doesnt matter how old you are.  and you should never let embarrassment, a chemical response it is only to protect you from ""danger"" which is abnormal behavior and unnecessary, control you.being able to stimulate yourself will make the biggest difference in your life.  just doing things, doesnt irritable mood thats all it is.  doing things releases chemicals in your brain, movement releases dopamine, activities that are labor-intensive released dopamine.  you being lazy is nothing more than a response.but as i said, dont hyperactive behavior chemicals control you.  use them to your benefit.  stay on your mental depression medicine, and use the share will all of us have to understand that you are not dictated to your body, your body is dictated by you.  you need to be stimulated.  and there a lot of fun things you can do.  but you got to be the one to play yourself out of the whole.  you can be happy.  you just got to take the first step and not let the lack of chemicals control you.love is nothing more than a chemical.  remember that.  true love is intellectual love.  humans get

"well, first things first. you have us here and whilst it might not seem hyperactive behavior much, being able to vent your feelings is a good way to start building back those bridges. family always seems to be a difficult one, you cannot choose your family but you can choose what interactions you have with them and whether they are positive or not. the fact that you are here, you seem more than intelligent and want help shows people you want to do something about it, anyone who would ignore you for that is not going to be the best of friends. its about finding the niche that you enjoy. reddit is a great place for that at least. what is it that you find yourself doing most of the time for a hobby? computers, reading etc? just dont give up, there is always a chance it will get better regardless of how dark it seems.
